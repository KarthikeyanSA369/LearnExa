Design and structure a complete frontend UI flow for a college academic web application titled “LearnExa – Learning Excellence and Analysis”, strictly based on the following approved requirements specification. This task is purely representational, not interpretative. All workflows, permissions, and academic logic must be preserved exactly as defined. Do not introduce any new features, behaviors, analytics, AI logic, or assumptions beyond what is explicitly stated.
The UI must follow a modern dark theme with neon accents, named “Neon Energy Dashboard”, using only the provided color palette without deviation. The design should feel student-friendly yet professional, suitable for an academic environment, with balanced layouts, clear typography hierarchy, smooth transitions, responsive behavior for both mobile and desktop, and subtle UI micro-interactions. Creative effort is allowed only at the presentation level, not in functionality.
Use the following color palette strictly: main page and dashboard background #0F172A, navigation bar background #22D3EE with text #020617, dashboard cards background #020617 with border #22D3EE, main headings #E0F2FE, sub-headings #A5F3FC, normal text #CBD5E1, light text #94A3B8, primary buttons #A855F7 with white text, secondary buttons #22D3EE with dark text, subject buttons background #020617 with border #A855F7 and text #A5F3FC, active subject buttons #22D3EE with text #020617. Heatmap colors must be green #22C55E for good, yellow #FACC15 for average, and red #F43F5E for needs improvement. Suggestion boxes must use background #020617, border #38BDF8, and text #E0F2FE.
Student basic details (name, class, section, roll number, register number, parent name, address) are imported only via CSV. Marks are never imported and must be entered manually by teachers only. Suggestions and tasks are written only by teachers. AI-generated suggestions or tips are strictly prohibited everywhere.
When the website opens, show a role selection screen with only two options: Teacher and Student.
For the Teacher flow, show a login screen with fields for teacher name and password. After login, display a teacher dashboard listing all students of the assigned class as clickable cards or buttons. Clicking a student opens the Student Mark Entry Page, which displays student basic details at the top, followed by a table-like structure for entering marks for predefined tests: Midterm Test-1, Quarterly Exam, Midterm Test-2, Half-Yearly Exam, Midterm Test-3, and Term/Annual Exam. Teachers must be able to enter subject-wise marks and dynamically add new test columns such as Unit Tests or Surprise Tests. Below the marks table, include a suggestion box where teachers write study suggestions and improvement tasks for that student only. A submit button saves marks and suggestions and updates the student dashboard immediately.
For the Student flow, show a login screen with fields for student name, class, and date of birth using a calendar picker. After login, show the student dashboard with a top section displaying student name, parent name, class and section, and class teacher name. Include a main score overview with cards for each exam showing total marks and percentage. Display a subject-wise marks section listing individual subject marks, totals, and percentages. Include an overall performance analysis section categorizing subjects into strong, average, and weak with visual progress bars. Add a heatmap section where subject buttons reveal test-wise performance using only green, yellow, and red indicators. Include a suggestions and tasks section showing only teacher-given suggestions with the date provided. Show a rank and level section displaying student rank in class and performance level (Beginner, Improving, Excellent, Top Performer). End the dashboard with a positive motivational greeting such as “Keep pushing forward! Your progress matters and improvement is always possible 🌟”.
Include a separate Admin Panel UI, accessible only via a direct URL such as /admin/login and never shown on the public role selection page. The Admin role is strictly limited to system-level management: creating teacher accounts, assigning credentials, viewing, editing, activating, and deactivating teacher accounts. Admin must never view or modify student data, marks, suggestions, dashboards, or rankings.
The Admin login screen must be centered on a dark background with a minimal, professional system-control appearance. After login, show an admin dashboard with a top navigation bar containing Admin Dashboard, Manage Teachers, and Logout. Display read-only overview cards for total teachers, active teachers, and deactivated teachers. The Manage Teachers screen must include an add-teacher form with fields for teacher name, assigned class, section, username, password, and confirm password, along with add and clear buttons. Below, display a teacher list table showing teacher name, assigned class and section, username, account status, and actions for edit and activate/deactivate only. No delete option is allowed. Editing opens a modal to update teacher details and password.
Admin UI must be visually distinct from teacher and student dashboards while still following the same Neon Energy Dashboard theme, color palette, typography, and responsiveness rules. Admin actions affect only login access and never academic data.
Strictly exclude AI features, analytics, automatic predictions, student data access in admin, marks viewing in admin, suggestions viewing in admin, and rank calculations beyond display. Ensure fast, clean, responsive UI suitable for college academic use, with clear role separation and permission-based visibility enforced at the UI level.
